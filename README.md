The course name is "BIOINFORMATICS FOR BIOLOGISTS: AN INTRODUCTION TO LINUX, BASH SCRIPTING, AND R"
People having no prior experience in Linux or Bash scripting can start this course at once but for completing this course and truly learn from it you have to search and dig a lot of resources. 
This course is three weeks long. In first two weeks you will get to know the syntax of the linux and how to use bash scripts. If you already know and used a little bit of Ubuntu or any linux distro then you can easily skip the first week. Most of us are used to in windows or mac platfroms, so using command prompt may be a barrier to us. In second week, you will start to write and execute simple shell scripts in order to automate processing of biological data.
